Task 1: Basic Vector Practice

```{r}
#Creating pre-treatment values
pre<-c(120,151,125,126,115,132,132,129,134,139,127,122,127,135,133,128,147,138,140,132)

#Creating post-treatment values
post<-c(127,145,135,122,115,122,123,126,126,129,132,146,120,114,121,120,128,120,133,115)

#Assigning attributes to vectors
paste("Subject",1:20,sep="_")

names(pre)<-paste("Subject",1:20,sep="_")

names(post)<-paste("Subject",1:20,sep="_")

#Calculating Change in BP vector
chg<-c(pre-post)

#Average decrease in BP
mean(chg)

#Determining who has a decrease in BP
which(chg>0)

#Subsetting Vector
chg[chg>0]

#Calculating Average decrease for those who had positive change

mean(chg[chg>0])
```
